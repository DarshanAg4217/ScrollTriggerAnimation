# ScrollTriggerAnimation

ðŸš€ Excited to Share My Latest Project! ðŸš€

Today, I dove into an innovative library that enables the creation of dynamic running animations from video content, leveraging ScrollTrigger, GSAP, and JavaScript. Here's a snapshot of what I accomplished:

ðŸ”¹ Video-to-Frame Conversion: Utilized tools to convert video into a series of frame images or utilized canvas for frame extraction.

ðŸ”¹ Scroll-Triggered Animations: Implemented ScrollTrigger and GSAP to synchronize animations with scroll events, creating a seamless and engaging user experience.

ðŸ”¹ Interactive Experience: Designed a website where the animation progresses in tandem with scrolling, offering a visually captivating interaction.

This project highlights the power of modern web technologies in creating interactive and immersive experiences. Looking forward to exploring more creative solutions and sharing further updates!
